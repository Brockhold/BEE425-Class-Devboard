This repository hosts the schematic and layout files for a TIVA-C TM4C123G breakout board.
The board was designed for BEE425 at UW:B, during winter 2019.

On the board are footprints for the following devices:
1 TO-220 LM35DT analog temperature sensor
1 16DIP ULM2003A darlington transistor array
1 18DIP NTE3074 common-anode two digit 7-segment LED display
1 TO-220 TIP29A NPN power transistor
2 T0-92 2N 3906 transistors
-- As well as an assortment of current limiting resistors, a protection diode, and a filtering cap. See schematic for details.


The board also includes otherwise-unrelated programming headers for an 6SOIC and an 8SOIC, for example the ATTINY10 and MX25L1606EM2I-12G.
